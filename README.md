### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Wesley Mario, a technology enthusiast since childhood. Currently pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development and seeking an experience as a developer, along with an opportunity to showcase my skills.

:orange_book: Expertise

Embarking on my professional journey, I am extremely focused and delighted with all the knowledge I have been acquiring throughout college, as well as through complementary courses to develop myself as a qualified professional. Currently, I am studying Java and Python, but at the moment, I am delving deeper into Java with external courses.

In Java, I am learning to use Spring to create better projects, benefiting from object-oriented programming, JSON, and two dependencies that greatly help in the project, which are Jackson and Gson.

Nevertheless, I intend to deepen my knowledge in Python. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, eager to become proficient in programming languages, and perhaps in other languages as well.
